Individualistic and nonjudgmental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path.

INFPs are creative and often artistic; they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression.

//	what does INFP stand for?
//	INFP is one of the sixteen personality types created by Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers, creators of the Myers-Briggs Types Indicator (MBTI). INFP stands for Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Percieving, 
//	which are four core personality traits based on the work of psychologist C.G. jung.

//	Each of the four letters of the INFP code signifies a key personality traits of this type. INFPs are energized by time alone (Intorverted), focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (Intuitive), 
//	make decisions	based on feelings and values (Feeling), and prefer to be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned and organized (Perceiving).
